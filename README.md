# [rc-mol](https://github.com/agdturner/rc-mol)

A modular Java application for loading, aligning and visualising ribosome data. This application is in development and not ready to be used by others. Progress will be reported in due course...

## Dependencies
- [ccg-v3d](https://github.com/agdturner/ccg-v3d)
- [ccg-r3d](https://github.com/agdturner/ccg-r3d)
- [ciftools-java](https://github.com/rcsb/ciftools-java)

## Development plans/ideas
- Load 2 ribosome data sets in CIF file format.
- Align one ribosome data to the other by implementing the [Kabsch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsch_algorithm).
- Export the transformed ribosome data in CIF file format.
